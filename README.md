Snake Game
Rules: How to play Snake
Use the arrow keys to move the snake and avoid hitting the square boundary the snake is in.
Collect the "food" items within the boundary to expand the snake.
Choose a path that allows the snake to continue to expand without running into itself or the square boundary. 
Each item collected will earn the player points.
Compete to earn the highest score possible before the round ends.
The round ends once the snake collides with a boundary or itself.

Layout:
Design: score in the center of the screen above the square boundary. 
Square boundary in the middle of the screen with the snake inside. 
The square boundary will be designed in css and have a nice border, not just a thin black line.
Snake will be a basic block design for the assignment with plans of enhancing later.
I want to create multiple js files, one for movement, one for functions, and one for the hit detection.
my goal is to first get the game functional, then add the beauty through css. Updating the background and the "food" items, as well as the layout for the rest of the page.
I will have a simple html file and one css file with a few js files.
